# Receipt Tracker   
This will be an IOS/Android app which will support finance tracking by allowing users to scan their receipts   
and receive analytics/summaries about their purchases.

The backend is built out with Python/Flask while the frontend will be developed with React Native.   
The data will be stored in an SQLite database.
